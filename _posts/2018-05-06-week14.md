So the question for our final blog post is to reflect on this class overall and say one thing we would remove from the class and one thing
we would add to the class.

Overall I have really enjoyed my time in this class. I have had a great time learning and have enjoyed the independence of the class that
we get to feel through our time in this class. I was not expecting to enjoy the class as much as I have. Overall it has been a very well
structured class just has felt a bit more like an independent study at times than a full on class. I don't have a lot of things that I 
want to remove but if I was being picky what I would like to remove where some of the invited speakers. I just felt sometimes that they
did not add a lot to the class and maybe there could be something more interesting to do in that time. I think it would be awesome to add
anothe phase of the original class website project just to get us more adjusted to git hub and maybe we try and do a pull request in a
group and tackle a bigger problem.

Thanks for the class!
