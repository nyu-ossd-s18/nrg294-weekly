Team contirbutions: My contributions this week have been centered around finding a way for us to track which color the user is clicking on 
so that we can allow them to pick from any color. I have been looking into the best way to do that within java script and how to implement
that within our u.i. and then update the colors taht are picked in response to that persons choice. This is going well and is getting close
to being done now.
