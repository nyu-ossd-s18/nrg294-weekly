- According to the Merrian Webster dictionary, the definition of the word humanitarian (adj) is "relating to or characteristic of people 
who work to improve the lives and living conditions of other people".   Consider the open source projects that you are familiar with 
(not necesserily the one that you are working on in this class). Could any of them  be classified as humanitarian  or having humanitarian 
aspect? Explain. 
  Yes they could be classified as humanitarian. We usally think of humantarian work as strictly something that is pretening to helping 
  people in need. However according to this dictionary definition that does not have to be the case. So with this definition anything that
  improves someones lives is considered to be humatarian. So for example open source projects such as Mozilla Firefox have worked to 
  imporve our lives by improving our connection to the interent. They have also worked to improve our online experience. Since they were
  working to improve this part of our lives their work was humanitarian.
