1) I have not done a pull request yet so this post will be in next weeks blog!


2) My code traige experience has been positive so far. Nothing crazy has happend just been getting emails about small bugs or issues. 
I signed up for one project that I got an issue for from 2014 and when looking through it seemed like a dead project so I left that one.
I am curreently signed up for 3 projects VScode. wkhtmltopdf, and godot. These projects seem very active and the emails I got had other 
people already commenting with potentail fixes. This nice as clearly these projects are very active, but because of the comments on my emails
I did not make any comments myself so I will wait for an eamil that warrants me helping out.
