I did not attend any open data week events as I had already attended all of my events.


Team Contributions: This week we started work on our plugin for Brackets. My job has been to work on the scaffolding of the plugin i.e. how 
it loads up and is displayed within brackets. I have done some initial research on how brackets works with oppening plugins. Jacob and I
have started working on loading hte U.I. in a window.
