For the team assement plan I think our strengths are that we are all comfortable with Java script which is what the code is written and we
are all very good at communicating with eachother so it will not be hard to stay up to date with what needs to get done. Also having a team
member that works with the program directly is a big help becasue we will be able to lean on that for understanding the code base.

Our team meeting time is on either Tuesday or Thursday at 5 pm - 7pm

Our milestones are getting bug reporting and commenting started.
Start working on fixing beginner bugs and then towards tackling larger issues.
Work on getting our pull request accepted.
Then making a fix to a bigger bug.

For open data week I am going to maximizing the value of open data on Thursday March 7th 5-5:45 pm Data Through Design: Art Exhibit.
