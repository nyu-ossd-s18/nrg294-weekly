Open Source Project:

  In this open source project I am looking to work on a project that is active and is something I would use myself.
    
  I am able to ffer my team my knowledge of collabarting in a big company and working with multiple team to make one finised project. I 
  will also bring my organization to the team.
  
 I am hoping to learn how to work in an open-source enviroment. I am looking forward to learning how to work with someone purely over the 
 internet and get the most out of that collabaration.
 
 I am most worried that I will take on something to big and not be able to make a solid contribution to the project.
 
 This week I made my pull request for the website fix.
 
 Here is a link to my pull request :https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18/pull/87
 
 Proposed question is: If you could go back and tell your old self one thing about how to collabarate in the open source community most 
 productively what would it be?
